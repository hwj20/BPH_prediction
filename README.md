# BPH_prediction


A Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia(BPH) risk prediction system.

The data is private and from physical examination.

It conatins three part: train(machine learning method in ./utils; deep learning method in ./deeplearn ), server(web app, in ./server_flask_web), client(web app, in ./client_flask_web).

You have the flexibility to customize parameters and code within your own module, while this project **serves as a reference example for any project that utilizes machine learning models in the backend and showcases the results through the frontend.**
